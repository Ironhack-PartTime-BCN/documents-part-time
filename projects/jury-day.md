# Jury Day

# Early Project Week
- choose format (panel vs speed dating and is popular vote on) `CREATE TASK jury format`
  - number of projects for hack-show depends on how many bootcamps present (typically min 3, max 5)
  - time of presentations to jury should not exceed 2h
- clarify students about purpose/process
- highlight to students:
  - no pressure, no drama
  - it's role-play
  - all judges are different
  - not an ideas/project/startup bootcamp
  - everyone is different
- role play with students once so that they get into the right mindset `CREATE TASK role play jury day`

# Speed Dating Format
- every student sits with each jury individually
- groups of 5 enter the room at a time and rotate all tables
- gather next group in advance
- max 2 minutes to show project, remaining lead by juror
- at least 2 minutes of time for jury questions
- heads-up the room at the 2 minute mark

# Panel Format
- each student presents to panel of judges
- 1 student in the room at a time
- max 2 minutes to show project
- at least 4 minutes of jury time
- each jury should ask at least a question
- observe quietly, but:
  - heads-up student at the 2 minute mark
  - remind student to answer quick/objectively if answers tooooo long

# Popular Vote (additional slots)
- consider electing 1/2 extra projects from popular vote
- consider who's allowed to vote
  - just students
  - TAs and Teachers
  - staff (that attended Thursday presentation)
- ask voters for 3 names (less chances of draws)
- sum all the votes, top 1/2 win
- if vote has same project X times, take one vote only

# Once we have jury list confirmed
- make sure everyone deployed
- create list of projects
- email juror's
  - [guidelines](./jury-guidelines.md)
  - project list (cards with names, project thumbs + student avatar, project URL, slide URL)

# Before Jury Time
- choose 1/2 TA to facilitate process
- make sure others stay with students
- print project lists for each jury to take notes
- prepare example questions for juries
- facilitate jury get together
  - meet in room straight from meeting time (not kitchen)
  - jury names on tables
  - round of introductions
  - round of Q&A so far
- briefing
  - explain process
  - distribute list of projects (cards, thumbs+avatar

# Prepare students
  - about the posture during presentation
  - language (basically..., etc)

# During the presentations
  - time warning when there are 4 minutes left, if possible silently (negociate with the judges after a few presentations)
  - control the outside noise

# Before Deliberation
- **make sure students stay in campus!**
- consider jury might need a break
- project list on whiteboard (cards, thumbs+avatar)
- facilitate start of discussion, asking quick questions (top of their heads)
  - 2 favs
  - most impressive UI
  - most complete project (most number of features)
  - most creative/surprising
  - most professional
  - most complex feature
  - best personal impression
- facilitate debate, make sure:
  - all juries participate
  - no project is forgotten
- consider: teachers can stay for jury deliberation (just for learning purpose)
- OR leave the room if conversation is flowing
  - tell them how much time they have left
  - comeback to ask for deliberation
  - facilitate voting if they can't reach consensus
    - vote for 3, sum all votes, pick X winners
    - repeat with subset if no clear winners emerge
    - A/B voting to break draws

# After Deliberation
- ask jury to stick around 15 mins for retrospective
- **gather all students!**
- prepare popular vote in case that format is going to be used
- juries present their choices
  - one choice per jury
  - in no particular order
  - explain why the selection
  - optionally, some honourable mentions
- popular vote now, so that we can share that with juries too

# Closing
- quick retrospective with jury/TAs
- make sure everyone talks
- take notes of everything
- ask questions
  - what did you most enjoy about the experience
  - how can we improve the judge experience
  - how can we improve the fairness of the deliberation
  - "what would X (success in fixing problem) look like"
