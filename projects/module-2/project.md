# Module 2

## Purpose/scope

## Reference project build

## Ideate (and validate ideas/scope)

## Planning
- show [github readme template](https://github.com/raphamontenegro/module2template/blob/master/README.md) and encourage them to do the same
- What is, main use cases
- User stories (MVP only)
  - 404 & 500 User stories
  - Signup, Login and Logout
  - max 5 other stories
  - everything else goes in the backlog, no details
- Wireframes
- Routes
  - method, path, params
  - one GET per view, one POST per form and action button
  - identify auth rules
  - what goes in request BODY
  - redirection after POST is handled
- Views
  - pages and identify partials
  - think layout (what are the variants of the header)
- Models (only 3 or 4 fields, MVP only)
- Tech investments
  - e.g.: bootstrap app
  - e.g.: install sass
- Challenges/Extras: Maps, Mail, File Upload, Social Login

## Control board

- keep daily track
- use red to signal blocks / warnings (e.g. no details about authorization rules for routes)
- standup in front of board
- columns:
  - who / project name
  - tech challenges (location, emails, uploads, ...)
  - user stories
  - wireframes 
  - board OR trello
  - README.md (sign-off)
  - bootstrap (app.js + launcher + eslint)
  - github (check .gitignore)
  - commits (count and update commits daily)
  - deploy 
  - presentation
