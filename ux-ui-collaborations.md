### Double Session

Experimented successfully with #webbcn0318 + #uxuibcn0318
- webdev students liked it a lot
- small contributions yielded great results on webdev projects
- feedback from ux/ui?
- contributed to bring the the two tribes together in terms of general campus life
- some pairs did not engage at all

- during webdev project week create webdev/ux pairs for 2 quick 30min sessions
- session 1 (early in the project, day 1/2)
- session 2 (late in the project, day 4)
- options:
  - dev explains project (share pitch, existing UX and wireframes)
  - ux gives feedback on major anti-patterns, quick fixes, low-hanging fruit
  - ux gives ideas
  - dev demos progress
  - dev asks for help

- checklist:
  - plan days/times in advance
  - explain to students in advance
  - create pairs in advance
  - brief all students on purpose/process before first session
  - run tight/energetic schedule (consider speed dating, buzzer, etc...)

### Pairing for project week

Experimented with #webbcn01117 + #uxuibcn1117
- only a few students really engaged
- adverse effects observed, especially for ux/ui students loosing focus on their course

### Cross summaries of the course

- Franco Rivas did a two hour session with whiteboards to #webbcn0318
- Sofia Dalponte did a two hour session with a slidedeck to #webbcn0318
- Sofia Dalponte did a one hour session with a slidedeck to #webbcn0618
- Andre Torgal did 2 one hour sessions with a slidedeck to #uxui0618
- general feedback is `awesome!`
