# Project Demos

## DOM Game Code Along

- do an up or down type of game where you try to guess if the next number is bigger or smaller than the next
  - example repo: https://github.com/tawebbcn/up-or-down
- do small steps and try to make sure that everyone is able to keep up
- if too lost, then ask to continue later
- start with main.js, building up the flow between the three screens

## Canvas Game Code Along

- do planing on the board and write the data structures and wireframe
- try to adapt the code from the previous code along if possible
- clean up the dom elements used to do the game
- build the new dom with the lives, score and canvas elements
- if you want to go responsive, make the div around the canvas flex:1 and inside of the game.js read the offsetHeight/offsetWidth and apply them to the canvas
