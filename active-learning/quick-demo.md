# Quick Demo

- teacher will code
- students will close their laptops and pay attention

- Make it clear that:
  - It is NOT a code along
  - They're not supposed to follow up, just pay attention
  - The snippets that are useful to them will be shared on slack
  - It's an opportunity to watch and learn

- TAs will be walking accross the classroom to clear any doubt
