# Mini-projects

Time for students to express themselves (what they love) and practice with what they learned so far.

## Planning
- define time available (e.g. 4 hours)
- define if students will present 1/2 mins what they did (factor in time)
- CREATE POST-IT for
- review example list below (add more, better, remove, ...)
- pick examples you are going to show
- schedule it, announce schedule to students

## Starting
- @todo THE FOLLOWING stuff could be a slide deck `mini-project-kick-off`
- show examples of what they can do
- ask them "before coming to the bootcamp, what were you dreaming you could do on your own after a while"
- explain purpose
  - apply what they learned so far to what they love
  - experiment with project setting (less directed than DE/PP)
  - solve they're own problems
- ask students to commit to an idea
  - small scope (tiny things)
  - 3 or 4 hours run super fast
- review their idea and sign-off (commitment)
  - give feedback on scope/expectations
  - but allow them to go crazy if that's what they want
- tell them that they will be presenting it in the auditorium on the following morning

*NOTE:* consider printing 1 copy of this page per TA to support observations

## During (observation)
- profile
  - what they love the most
  - what *they think* they are better at
  - creative vs technical
  - problem solving
  - communication (help! this is not working)
- behaviours
  - afraid vs crazy
  - listens to our feedback and adjusts expectations (scope)
  - sticks to commitment vs wanders off
  - stays focused vs procrastinates
  - asks for help vs frustrated on their own
  - hacker (copy paster) vs coder
  - sloppy  vs gold plater
- blockers
  - irrealistic expectations / scope
  - ignoring tools (turn your shoes on)
  - misconceptions
  - behind learning
  - problem solving
  - asking for help, communicating
  - frustation, vibe

## Closing
- consider presenting to class / subgroup if class too big
- ask them the slide questions (challenges, learnings, start from scratch, highlights)
- give individual feedback
  - celebrate achievements
  - highlight observed behaviours
- give collective feedback
  - most popular anti-patterns
  - e.g.: `use strict, turn your shoes on`
  - e.g.: `google first, ask for help later`
  - e.g.: `I have an error that says "foo undefined on line x" and need help` is better than `it doesn't work`
