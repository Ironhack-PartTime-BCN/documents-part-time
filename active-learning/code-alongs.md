# Code Along

## How it works

- teacher codes, demonstrates process
- students follow always trying to achieve same outcome

- break it into small steps
  - plan 2/3 steps ahead
  - each step needs a purpose
  - and verifiable outcome(s)

- consider using pair/trio programming
  - use same pairs as PP (TODO notes on daily pair)
  - designate drivers if needed
  - explain pairing if needed

- explain process to students
  - that it's broken into steps
  - that they need to complete each step
  - that they need to assert, vocally, unanmbiguosly that they have completed the step
  - or ask for help
  - that the process can be exhausting
  - that 100% focus is required
  - that silence is required, no conversations (unless pairing)
  - that focus shifts from teacher to students and back and they need to follow that

## Start step
- annouce each next step with clarity
- explain the purpose
- why it's needed
- what outcome we are after
- what it increments or fixes

## Measure the room
- ask if purpose is understood
- in many cases, not understanding purpose is perfectly natural
- take level of the room (understanding of purpose) into account
- if students feel overwhelmed, ask if they need a break

## Demonstrate step
- show process/code
- use best practices
- explain as you code
- stay on track
- focus only on the outcome
- avoid tangents at all cost (take note, you can come back later)
- show the outcome clearly
- undo/redo to demo before/after
- focus on the main outcome
- don't show secondary outcomes or side effects (if any) yet
- save that for recap/closure

## Feedback
- ask for feedback/questions as you demonstrate
- repeat step (or parts of) if several people are asking for it
- answer all questions related to the code/process
- demonstrate undo/redo to illustrate answers
- take note of tangent questions, don't answer now
- flow, energy, rhythm and focus are crucial

## Prepare hand-over to students
- highlight what everyone needs to achieve in the current step
- quickly remind what code / process needs to happen
- clearly state what check(s) students need to make to confirm they have completed the step
- "you will know you're there WHEN you refresh the browser THEN xxx happens AND no network errors in console"
- remember false positives, sometimes 2 or more checks are required
- keep the projector focused on the main outcome for students to compare
- show code/terminal side by side with outcome if possible
- or briefly switch to code/terminal if students ask for it
- and then switch back to the outcome

## Wait for ALL students to complete
- tell the students how much time you expect them to take (your guesstimate)
- remember that first steps are always the ones with more surprises
- every code-along, students are expected to become faster/better
- remind everyone that once they're done they can help others
- take the opportunity to observe students/pairs (TODO move notes elsewhere, also valid for PP, Kata and Project)
  - take notes if needed
- clearly ask "CAN WE CONTINUE?"
- and demand arms raised or an unambiguous vocal yes
- make sure everyone completed it

## if help is still needed
- ask "WHO'S BLOCKED?"
- teacher and TAs need to flock to blocks
- if 2 blocks and 4 teachers, all go! pair!
- do not break into conversations with other students
- ask all other students to not break into conversations
- preserve vibe, concentration, focus of the room
- tell others to observe the debugging, it's an opportunity to learn more

## Persitant blocks
- diagnose cause
  - system, environment, servers
  - tools, apps
  - technical debt (previous step were incomplete, imperfect, too dirty or actually broken)
- a TA can quickly try to solve the problem as we move to the next step
- and keep helping to allow student/pair to catch up with next step
- if it takes too long (deep into next step)
  - consider closing this laptop until the end of the code-along
  - re-pair student(s) with other students/pairs
- if system broken
  - student should take a note, it's the students responsibility to chase help

## Closure on the step (mini-lecture)
- give feedback to students on how they performed
- celebrate the achievements
- "good, 2 minutes! you're getting much faster/better"
- ask for focus on the teacher
- remember the purpose of the step (increment/fix)
- highlight what we achieved (outcome)
- quickly recap process/code
- show secondary outcomes, or side effects, of the step, if any
- show possible options for next step
- pick a single next step, introduce it
- repeat
- don't forget to keep planning 2/3 steps ahead

## Closure on the code-along
- give feedback
- questions & answers
  - recover notes
  - use notes taken during code-along
  - opportunity to answer deffered questions
  - opportunity for address tangential topics
  - incite everyone to ask
  - ask questions back to unlock silence
- recap
  - original purpose, desired outcome
  - summary of steps
  - pitfalls
  - problems/accidents and learnings
  - best practices
  - secondary outcomes, side effects, if any
  - final outcome
- point to next steps
  - possible options, what would follow this
  - options to recap/practice on your own
  - options to
- ask for feedback
