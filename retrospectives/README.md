## retrospective morning

  - gather materials ()
  - @todo WE NEED TO TRY THIS ONE write down all personal `learnings`, `if I were to start from scratch` from the presentations in a whiteboard
  - call everyone in!
  
# structure 
- **15min** - opening
  - facilitor explains the purpose, process, and expected outcomes of the retrospective
  - "we can only be as good as the feedback you give to us"
  - purpose is to reflect how the team is working together
  - not just about the project, the whole module
  - purpose is not to rant/complain (remember there are other feedback loops, such as 1to1 too)
  - examples of things they should feel free to question the way we do them
    - stand-ups
    - pairing
    - daily exercises
    - exercise reviews
    - PR replies
    - [active learning activities](./active-learning.md)
    - lectures
    - katas
    - project planning/sign-off
    - project presentation practice
    - presentations
  - we will first "play a little game" to get the conversation going
  - and then have a discussion
  - and hopefully arrive at some actions (things we can change for the next module)
    - things to each improve personally
    - things to all improve as a group
    - things the teacher and the TAs can improve
- **20min** gather data 
  - write post-its
  - and/or make a drawing
  - and/or open question to the group
  - options
    - what they liked most/least on the project/module
    - what was the highest/lowest moment of the project/module
    - what thing someone else does they most love/annoys them
    - what thing we do ourselves we are proud/sorry for
    - draw the team as a super-hero (include super power/weakness)
    - draw your project as a super-product (include super feature/bug)
- **30min** generate insights 
  - facilitor helps team stay on topic(s) and interrupt long tangents
  - focus on actions, if one emerges put it up (board/post-its) so everyone sees
  - write insights/feelings as they emerge
- **20min** discuss actions 
  - group actions under stop, start, continue
  - OR under topic (stand-ups, ..., katas, ...)
  - make sure team agres on the actions
  - if team is not unanimous, facilitor must ask: "can we agree to do this as an experiment?"
- **10min** closing
  - facilitor provides feedback
  - and explains the next steps
    - the picture of the board and an `actions.md` will be shared on slack
    - a 1or2 word post-it representing each action/experiment will be near the standup to remind the team
 

## after the retro

- cleanup raw notes written down during the retro (what people are saying, how they're feeling) [example](./retrospectives/es-0618/module-1/es0618-module1-retrospective-raw.md)
- create an actions file with the possible actions/experiments to improve our process (./retrospectives/es-0618/module-1/es0618-module1-retrospective-actions.md)
- a picture of the board/post-its generated [example](./retrospectives/en-0618/module-1/IMG_8858.JPG)
- upload these three files to the cohort's folder in ./retrospectives [example](./retrospectives/en-0618)
- put up post-its with actions/experiments near the stand-up area 
- share actions and picture on cohort's slack channel **and pin those messages**
